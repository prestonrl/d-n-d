The vial in [[Siri]]'s chest cavity

Looks like thick water with sickly green swirl to it

[[Siri]] is unable to give un-redacted information about it

Seems to be the key to [[Sylas]]'s immortality 

Can be refined

[[Siri]] is to keep it safe

[[Bruk]] soldered the hatch shut so the vial is still in [[Siri]]'s chest
