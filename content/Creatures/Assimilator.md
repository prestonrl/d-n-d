The creature [[Aben]] created through [[Hemocraft]] the night of the wedding of [[Reginald]] and [[Seraphina]].

A creature made out of the skin and blood of a number of [[Cultists]]. Made in a vat. 3 separate bodies were skinned.

It built itself. Has the glowing effects of [[Mutagen 2]]. It is a puppet of the [[mutagen]] in a way.

Not fully developed in [[mutagen]] to infect anyone yet. But could get to that point eventually.

Reacts to fire.

Doesn't react to [[Perrin]]'s icy blade.

Took down [[Aben]] and [[Perrin]]

Uses [[Hemocraft]] to assimilate [[Aben]]'s left arm, but can't use the gun in his hand.
