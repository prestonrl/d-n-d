A form taken by [[Flicker]] which allows them to shape shift and grow wings and take on a beastly figure with red scales. Looks like a small dragon like creature, that is smaller than a wyrmling dragon. Has a sliver of gold scales across his right eye when in this form.

Can fly.

Can carry other [[Cultists]] of the [[Circle of Embers]] when in this form.

Damage taken in this form sometimes translates to half-elf form. Like when his dragon head was cut off he had a gash on his neck after morphing back.
