[[Elias]] and [[Tobias]] ask [[Alisha]] to find a ring
ruby ring

Seems to have been found in the [[Blind Beholder Briar Outpost]]

It has a light dispelling enchantment on it. 

Is the ring that [[Trevor]] and [[Seraphina]] used to provide a way for [[Elias]] to recover his memories.

There is a time limit to recover the memories. 
- The more time that passes the less can be recovered
- After a month it becomes harder
- After two months the recovered memory is fractured
- Three months is too late
