The [[primal divide]] and the [[dark divide]] when talked about together

These divides progressing to the point of touching each other would be a bad thing 

There would be intense consequences if the magics from each divide interact

The [[Blind Beholder]] is tracking the divides and making sure nothing gets in or out

Over the course of 80 years they have progressed many miles. This kingdom used to be a peninsula and now is not.
