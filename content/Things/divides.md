The [[primal divide]] and the [[dark divide]] when talked about together

These divides progressing to the point of touching each other would be a bad thing 

There would be intense consequences if the magics from each divide interact. When dimensions meet is will be a big explosion.

The [[Blind Beholder]] is tracking the divides and making sure nothing gets in or out

Over the course of 80 years they have progressed many miles. This [[Sylvan Star Crossed Kingdom]] used to be a peninsula and now is not.

Information about them is not publicly available, and is actively being suppressed. 

The exact rate of growth is 1.25 miles per year. It is constant over time. 

The [[calamity]] began the divides encroaching on our plane.
