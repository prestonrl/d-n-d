Dear [[Perrin]] Marak,

Stand Down

This is not your fight, sir. I have been waiting for 300 odd years for someone to ask the question you posed: Why is the Society of the [[Blind Beholder]] entitled to choose what magic is and isn't legal?

They aren't.

It would be a shame to lose such intuition.
