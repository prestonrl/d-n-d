Dear [[Perrin]],

Its so nice to finally put a name to the face, and wow. Your face Just Will Not stop showing up, will it? We've had a number of well, "mishaps" lets call them, during our past outings. A couple in [[Shanon]], a couple in [[Bruelethor]], but most insulting of all were the five who survived [[Rookwatch]].

Well...
Lets call it three now.

Don't worry, Perrin, I'll cut to the chase. I need your help. I don't ask for much. All I need is for you to come and meet me. That's literally it. I am atop the southern wall. I bear no weapons, no magic, and have brought no allies, I would appreciate if you did the same. A purely diplomatic request.

In return I offer answers. Anything I know I'll tell you. No limits whatsoever.

Its important to note, however, that I also have an ultimatum if you turn down my request. Fail to comply with my conditions or fail to show up before midnight, and our three mishaps become two. I was knighted due to my ability to finish the job that [[Atlas]] started. Understand that I have no qualms nor moral obligation not to kill this one. I hope I make myself clear.

As a show of good faith, I offer this. My name is [[Flicker]] Frouden. I come from the ancestral home of dragons. was knighted' roughly one week ago as the eleventh [[Archdruid]] of the [[Circle of Embers]]. I hope to see you soon, Perrin.
