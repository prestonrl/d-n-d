The plant that [[Siri]] was working with in the [[Cultbusters HQ]] 

Subject 4

Dropped when falling down the stairs

[[Siri]] tried to clean it and repeats that this is very important

Grows well for a plant that doesn't get much sun.

[[Basil]] has the feeling that natural magic wouldn't work on this plant

[[Siri]]'s instructions on the plant:
- 5 minutes of sunlight each day
- Water is optional
- Subject 4 must be dealt with very carefully
- Lock on chest is broken and ajar
- needs to be kept in containment
- Subject is related to the chasi somehow
