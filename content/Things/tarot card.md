Seen in the black void of the [[black orb]] after saying the name of [[Bimuna]]

The face has an ancient dragon on it. The dragon is older than any dragon I have yet encountered. Older than the [[Cultists]] and [[Atlas]].

The back is a simple ink pen.

[[Atlas]] came to the [[Hightower Estate]] shortly after I returned with this card and he skewered me on his sword and took this card from me.

[[Atlas]] has the path to become immortal again with this card.
