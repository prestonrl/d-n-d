Found on the table at the showcase of the [[Aurum Briar Party]] after the fight with [[Sylas]].

[[Perrin]] gives it to [[Reginald]] to determine what it is and he keeps the sword

A very old looking normal sword that just happens to scream when unsheathed 

Has some light [[shadowfell]] on the sheath
