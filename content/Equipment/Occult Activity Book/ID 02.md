[[Occult Activity of Old Victoris]]

Leader: [[Hale Blackbridge]]

Following Colloquial Name:
[[The Archaic Circle]]

Details:
We have yet to encounter any [[druids]] of this circle, and the evidence to their existence is circumstantial at best.

We've been encountering the ancient [[ruins]] of their ritual sites for years now. The only problem being that each site seems to be centuries old, yet survey expeditions from a week prior show they never existed at all.

Our experts hare only been able to decrypt one name from the runes: [[Hale Blackbridge]] 

Status:
Unknown
