- Rode away from [[Shanon]] after [[Festival]] destroyed by [[dragon]] 
- encountered the camp of [[Geros]] and [[Dracor]] who were on their way to [[Shanon]]
- Relayed the fate of [[Shanon]] to them, and was promptly put under an attempted arrest by [[Geros]] who assumed it was my fault despite my telling him otherwise
- Agreed to travel with [[Dracor]] and [[Geros]] to the [[Briar Estate]] just so that I could tell them what happened and because I was traveling that way anyway
- Do not trust [[Geros]]
- On the way we came upon the [[monastery]] where we met [[Alisha]]
- [[Alisha]] has been sent to check up on the [[monastery]]
- All [[monastery]] inhabitants were warped and disfigured and entombed in [[ice]]
- Explored [[monastery]] finding [[healing potions]] a chest and a library with a [[puzzle door]]
- Solved the puzzle and went up to the bell tower where the body of [[Willow]] was found
- [[Dracor]] touched the body of [[Willow]] and she animated to life casting a spell that was tainted by the [[Mutagen 2]] magic
- [[Dracor]] proceeded to die a horrible death
- With the help of [[Alisha]] and [[Geros]] we took down the corpse of [[Willow]]
- [[Willow]] apologized to [[Alisha]] as she died and we found the key to the chest
- [[Geros]] gathered the bones of [[Dracor]] his friend to bury later and put them in his pack
- the chest contained a letter of apology which explained the [[ice]] was used to stop the spread of the [[Mutagen 2]]
- I found that the green [[Mutagen 2]] seemed to have arrived by the waterways
- Discovered [[Khione]] and [[Finn]] who are apprentices of the [[Arch Cryomancer]]
- [[Khione]] and [[Finn]] claimed to have come from [[Shanon]] despite knowing nothing about the events of the [[Festival]] night with the [[dragon]]
- Headed out towards the [[Cryomancer's Keep]]
