 - [[Geros]] throws [[moss]] to keep [[Drayax]] [[Drayax's ring]] safe before we fall
 - Come to surrounded by snow and rubble 
 - [[Drayax]] projects into battlefield 
 - The [[Arch Cryomancer]] goes down and 5 [[mutagen]] enemies come
 - Each of the enemies targets one of us specifically 
 - Use my attacks on the red eyed one ([[Blight of the Fallen Puppet]]) using hail of thorns. He is now dead and I recognize him as the cultist [[Crackle]] that the [[skeleton]] of [[Sylas]] reanimated in [[Dungeon outside Shannon]]
 - [[Aben]]'s decay goes to stage 2 
 - as we defeat them the tendrils recede and the walls collapse and the mutant [[lich heart]]s die
 - But outside the wall we see hundreds of red robed [[Cultists]].
 - The [[Arch Cryomancer]] wakes up with cavity in his chest showing a beating [[crystal heart]] 
 - [[Geros]] cuts [[Arch Cryomancer]] in half and cracks the [[crystal heart]] with divine smite
 - [[dragon 2]] with the [[Circle of Embers]] is circling above
 - I talk to [[Arch Cryomancer]] and ask if the [[cracked Crystal Heart]] can save us
 - He says nothing can save us but the spells of [[Mausoleum of Levistus]] and hands me a Levistus [[runic tablet]] with a blue ruin on it that is a spell that may save us but cost much
 - [[Drayax]] takes the [[runic tablet]] and will cast it due to him having 10 copies of the [[Mausoleum of Levistus]] 
 - I whistle for [[Bailey]] to run out 
 - I grab the [[cracked Crystal Heart]] from the [[Arch Cryomancer]] and prepare my [[grappling hook]]
 - I ride [[Bailey]] and grapple the [[Drayax's ring]] to me 
 - This [[dragon 2]] is not the same [[dragon]] that destroyed [[Shanon]] but it lands in front of [[Drayax]]
 - [[Drayax]] cast spells with the [[runic tablet]] and the [[Mausoleum of Levistus]] pages and blips out of existence 
 - The ice encases [[dragon 2]] and grows through the whole city like a large crystal as we ride away
