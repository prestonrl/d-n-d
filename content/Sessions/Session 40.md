	- There is a medium sized creature slowly gaining form
		- The [[Assimilator]]
	- [[Aben]] shoots it and it doesn't go far enough into the cartilage to do damage

	- I hear the gunshot and dash to the basement outside the door
		- I try to break the lock and fail
	- The [[Assimilator]] is going through [[Aben]]'s left arm, using [[Hemocraft]] to creating a seam around his shoulder and arm disconnects it. It fuses the arm to become part of itself.

	- 3 separate  bodies have been skinned 
	- Has [[Aben]]'s left hand with his [[gun]] in it, but can't use it
	- It built itself, and has the glowing effects of  [[Mutagen 2]]
		- It is a puppet of the [[mutagen]] in a way
		- Is not fully developed in [[mutagen]] to infect anyone yet, but could get to that point eventually 
		- It reacts to fire. Not my icy blade
	- I get attacked and loose a lot of damage, and get picked up and slammed into the ground 
		- I go down for the first time
		- [[Alisha]] heals me and pushes me away from the creature

	- Books encased in skin
	- Vials of many items

		- 1 Guardian blight vial
		- 1 congealed [[Mutagen 2]] biomass
		- 3 [[Mutagen 2]] samples
	- Jar filled with dirt and a plant
	- 3 bodies on the table

- [[Jadaya]] hits [[Aben]]
- [[Geros]] lights the bodies on fire
- [[Geros]] goes on a quest to find [[Wilbur]] again for a lady
	- [[Wilbur]]'s house is flying above the city

	- [[Geros]] flys up to check it out
		- Sees a [[Cultists]] on the city wall.
		- [[Geros]] creates a crater on the wall and the [[Cultists]] disappears
	- [[Geros]] got iron man [[gauntlets]] that shoot radiant light
	- The lady who had hired [[Geros]] is [[Amasthesia]]!!
		- I ask her about [[Shanon]] and how she escaped the [[dragon]]
			- she teleported out
		- I introduce her to the group.
		- I ask her about
			- The [[Ichor]]
				- Where she is from
			- The [[Silent Colossus]]
			- [[Old Victoris]]
			- The cost to grow back [[Aben]]'s left arm
				- 150 gold for perfect arm
				- 50 for a clearly not correct, but good enough arm
- [[Madeline]] wants to go back to look for [[Alex]]
- [[Basil]] pulls me aside and asks if i can get a plush rat from [[Madeline]] house for her in the [[Crucible]]
	- Me [[Jadaya]] and [[Alisha]] go to [[Madeline]] house to pick up the plush and groceries
	- a red robed [[slender cultist]] ducks outside the window
		- They jump back over the railing and disappear without a trace. 
- We explore the [[Crucible]] more
	- I go into [[Arcane Commodities and Oddities]] #2
	- [[Bubbles]]!!
