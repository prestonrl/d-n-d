Created by [[Atlas]] in [[Old Victoris]] before the [[calamity]].

Has a domed roof, an oculus, and is very large.

[[Atlas]] claimed it was a way to access the planes/planets beyond 
- [[Astral Plane]]

Showed a vision of the end, that [[Atlas]] is trying to avoid by having his [[Cultists]] of the [[Circle of Embers]] burn everyone and everything first.

It ruptured and was one of the three events that caused the [[calamity]]. 

[[Atlas]] is rebuilding it in [[New Victoris]] as one last try to save people. It wont solve the [[calamity]] but would help people escape the [[divides]]

Needs four [[Channeling Tower]]s throughout the city. Each tower is assigned a god to channel through the citadel. Like the [[black orb]] [[epithet]] of the [[Earthmother]].

The [[black orb]]s are connected to the [[negative energy plane]] to power the [[Citadel]]

The center has a large pedestal that will act as a gate

Takes a lot of lives to power.

It will take [[Atlas]] and others to another plane.

Is being tried again as a Plan B due to [[Lady Frouden]]'s request that [[Atlas]] try something else before the [[Silence]]
