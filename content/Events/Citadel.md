Created by [[Atlas]] in [[Old Victoris]] before the [[calamity]].

Has a domed roof, an oculus, and is very large.

[[Atlas]] claimed it was a way to access the planes/planets beyond 
- [[Astral Plane]]

Showed a vision of the end, that [[Atlas]] is trying to avoid by having his [[Cultists]] of the [[Circle of Embers]] burn everyone and everything first.

It ruptured and was one of the three events that caused the [[calamity]]. 

[[Atlas]] is rebuilding it in [[New Victoris]] as one last try to save people. It wont solve the [[calamity]] but would help people escape the [[divides]]
