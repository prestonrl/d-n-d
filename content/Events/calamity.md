The destruction of [[Old Victoris]] and all its people save for [[Atlas]] and [[Sylas]]

Everyone in the city was petrified in a way that cannot be recovered from.

Unclear how this started. But the job it started was the [[Silence]].

[[Sylas]] and [[Atlas]] claimed to have tried to stop this and its effects, but eventually were convinced by it that the world needs to end in order for there to be [[Silence]]. 

[[Atlas]] says 3 events caused the calamity.
 1. The [[Citadel]] rupturing when contacting the [[Astral Plane]]
 2.  unknown
 3. unknown

Something beyond the gods contained it
