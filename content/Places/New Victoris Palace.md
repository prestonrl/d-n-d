A tower in the center of [[New Victoris]] atop the [[pedestal]]. It is luxurious and reminiscent of Versailles.

There is a bridge to the main doors.

The doors open to a long hallway with the door to the throne room at the far end. There are doors on the sides down the hall. 

The palace is serviced by [[automaton]]s that are made of small planks with runes on them. They are scarecrow like.

The throne room is massive with glass walls in the back with a view of the [[northern district of New Victoris]]

The throne itself is luxurious, and has elvish runes
