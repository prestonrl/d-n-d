The magic shop in the [[Maw]] at [[New Victoris]] owned by [[Wilbur]]

Has a machine with panels and dials with technology that looks similar to [[Blind Beholder]] tech.

Takes magic items for vouchers to make new magic items

After [[Wilbur]] imbued [[Bimuna]] and the [[New Flame]] and other gods into the  [[maul of the pantheon]] this workshop was levitated into the air 800 feet and stuck there, leaving a crater where the shop was.

[[Feather Fall]] is part of the workshop building
