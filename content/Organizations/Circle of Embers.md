Note from this organization found in [[Dungeon outside Shannon]]. Note foreshadowing an even called the [[inferno]] and a mysterious ancient figure named [[Atlas]]

The organization of the [[Cultists]] 

They are [[druids]] that can shape shift

Has at least eleven [[Archdruid]]s

Was in ancient times known as the [[Ember Guard]] as found in the [[Blind Beholder Briar Outpost]] museum 

They want to wipe out every town and creature

[[Sylas]] hasn't heard of them in a long time

They want to finish the job that the [[calamity]] started, which is the [[Silence]].

The plan to die with everyone else.

They see the [[primal divide]] and [[dark divide]] as the inevitable end of the world. By killing every town and creature they believe this is a merciful end to the world rather than wait for it to be consumed by the divides.

Their M.O. is to stake outside a city and investigate and take down infrastructure for combating fires so that when they burn it down they make the most damage.

Completely oblivious to [[mutagen]]
