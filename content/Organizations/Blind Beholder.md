An organization we keep running into

[[Trevor]] and [[Aben]] are members

They have the [[Labyrinth]] system of [[train]] tunnels under the world

They wrote the book [[Occult Activity of Old Victoris]]

Is about the restriction of knowledge for safety. 
They restrict all blood magic [[Hemocraft]]. They track all groups that use outlawed [[Hemocraft]]

Presumably build the [[Dungeon outside Shannon]] to contain [[Sylas]]

Most likely the builders of the original [[automaton]]s 

Very technologically advanced, have security cameras and monitoring stations, ID's, guns, etc

Trades [[Memory Potion]]'s with the [[Five Pillars]]
