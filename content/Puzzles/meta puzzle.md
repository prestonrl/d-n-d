There is a letter in he room, I have hidden the key in the room a clear box with green spindly bits, a room with boxes and a white ladder and a saint in red, spinning blades across the room that are cold compared to hot room, wrought iron equipment, glowing device pumped with electricity wrapped in a cage, one normal door in the back of the room and two large medal doors off to the left, the letter describes a black table, a round black table, bright white lights on the ceiling
