Finished the healing elixir formula.

Honestly, it's quite hard to increase the potency without exponentially boosting the cost. Standard is more efficient.

It seems that the more popular potion brands don't actually use "more magical" ingredients at all. They simply include higher protein and water, which your body needs to continue repairing you after the active ingredients dissolve into mundane. 

That, plus a bit of caffeine and/or adrenaline.
