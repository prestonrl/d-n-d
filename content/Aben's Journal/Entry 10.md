It happened. [[Trevor]] walked up to my desk, and dropped off the old reports on [[gold]]

[[Gold]] is immune to time. It does not decay or corrode. However it does channel electrical and Arcane ([[Arcane Energy]]) currents VERY well.

This why it was used to make the temporal [[automaton]]s.

If I was experiencing a temporal anomaly, the [[Minute Men]] guard shift would be 1 day off, like me.

If I'm not experiencing a temporal anomaly, what am I experiencing?
