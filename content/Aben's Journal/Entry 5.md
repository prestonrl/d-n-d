Another capsule was brought in by the [[Minute Men]] today: True Eclipse [12th Lvl] 

It uh... It destroys the sun. Surprisingly simple in concept.

I imagine this would have been useful to a clan of [[vampire]]s or something. Potentially [[trolls]]? Nah, they don't care for magic like [[vampire]]s do.

In any case, T-1 passed it up through the [[Minute Men]] capsule, and now it's being disassembled into abstract in the [[Spell Cracker]]. Won't harm anyone anymore up here.

Side note: Who gave all of the temporal [[automaton]]s creepy hollow eyes?
