Entry 2
11/23/78

Had to attend a meeting this morning. At least it was directed by ~~Trevor~~ [[Trevor]] Mr. Briar. 

He's not... fun, per se, but he's not nearly as twitchy as the other directors. There's a mutual respect there.

The discussion was a refresh on the access [[helms]] hidden above ground in [[New Victoris]] proper, with a âƒ¤ symbol.

Meeting ended at 1:00
