Whoever's in the timeline below me, I hope you're happy because I am now SOAKED in coffee.

That's the main problem with the standard issue temporal [[automaton]]s. They follow clockwork paths to save on resources across all timelines.

Ignore the bootstrapping paradox.

3* HPMax-2*HPeurrent

Dark grass rate * bonus

Avg lvl 50 Golurk: 173 maxHP
маxHР=173
currentHP= 259=44
Previously caught =300 unique → Dark Grass= 0.7
Catch Rate =90
P-ball bonus= Great Ball= 1.5
Status bonus= Sleep = 2.5
d= 3*173-2*447
*0.7*90*1.5*2.5*4,046
3*173
2= [0.63]*967,680
x= 803,175 = Catch Rate

b= 65364911094480]

b = 65,536x0.936 = 61,376%=Shake probability

Welp, I definitely messed up the calculation somewhere.
