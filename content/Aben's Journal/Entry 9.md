I could have sworn today was Dec 1st.

I remember [[Trevor]] coming over and dropping off the old reports on [[gold]].

I remember completing my research:

I remember standing alone staring into the stasis tank. ([[stasis chamber]])

So why don't I have those reports? How is it that Trevor's been on family leave for almost 2 days now? Where are my finished papers? And what the hell is with this headache?

Okay. So we think about this logically.

Why [[gold]]?

New inquiry: Research documents on the properties of [[gold]]?

All reports in the archive's possession appear to be within the past couple hundred years.

The ones I'm imagining are at least a few thousand. Like before the [[Alexandria Protocol IV]]. The most recent one that is. There's always a couple stragglers after each wipe.
