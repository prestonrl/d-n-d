They may think their spells are fast, but time will always catch them first.

I admit, the gods are not that helpful, but if you actually KILL one, then an organization like ours has to pick up the pieces. I'd ask why they don't learn, but that's our fault isn't it?

Honestly, memory magic is the one part of this job I find a little upsetting.
