Entry 1
11/22/78

We are... 1/2 an entry in and I appear to have already written the book upside-down.

Excellent start.

The paperwork needed to get this thing was too tedious to do it again. I finally get to have a break from writing in invisible ink and codes. That's too good to pass up on.

Today has been rather uneventful. Worked til 8:00 on items from the previous Journal.

I need to send an inquiry to the [[Archive]] before 10:00 in order to finish that health elixir formula.

New inquiry: I need records for stable arcane healing potions of the standard, greater, superior, and legendary varieties.
