[[Goblin]] blood. Goblin blood is wild. Turns out they use RNA editing, not DNA splicing. This means that they're INCREDIBLY unstable genetically, and, even more concerningly, might be related to squids.

DNA splicing
incorrect strands are cut.
No mutation
No adaptation 
- Humans
- Dwarves
- Halflings
- Gnomes
- Basically everything

RNA editing
several "incorrect" DNA strands
RNA picks its fav
Fast adaptation
Deadly mutiations
- [[goblin]]s
- squids
- mostly extinct shit
