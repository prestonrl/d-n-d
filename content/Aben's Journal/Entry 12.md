Bimonthly checkup on the [[Order of the Profane Soul]] & the [[Order of the Mutant]]s & the [[Order of the Lycanthrope]]:

- - - 

PROFANE SOUL:

Our Scryer at [[Deepsight]] [[ruins]] reports standard occult activity & sacrifice, but they have yet to re-develop [[Hemocraft]] with the human blood.

Confirmed.

Obscene, but not against regulations.

MUTANT:

Our Scryer in [[Shenandoah]] confirmed that the [[Southern Lockdown System]] is still holding strong.

Confirmed.

LYCANTHROPE:

Our Scryer in the [[City of Wisps]] reports that the effects of [[lycanthropy]] have not passed the Carthion ([[Sylas]]) limit of blood manipulation to be considered [[Hemocraft]]. 

The [[Order of the Lycanthrope]] is always the biggest headache in this process

Speaking of headaches, I need to clock out early today.
