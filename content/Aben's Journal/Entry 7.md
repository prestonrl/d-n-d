New inquiry: Is it normal to feel like your lungs are filled with sand?

Or to have fatigue so intense that you sleep for 32 hrs and miss a day of work?

Something's wrong.
- ﻿﻿No fever
- ﻿﻿Gravely throat but no active cough
- ﻿﻿No congestion
- ﻿﻿No dizziness
- ﻿﻿No pain

[[Trevor]] seemed upset at my absence, but also appeared to be distracted something: Assumedly a family matter.

Oh gods

New symptom:
- Weak stomach

I'm definitely right. Something's definitely wrong. Nothing I ate yesterday was that shade of green. ([[Mutagen 2]])

Especially considering I didn't eat ANYTHING yesterday on account of the fatigue.

All I can do is keep my head down, work on this formula, and nurse this headache
