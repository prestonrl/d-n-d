[[Werewolf]] Blood

While on my adventures a companion of mine ([[Geros]]) has collected many vials of different liquids, mainly blood. Recently he gave me these vials of different bloods to inspect, with my past knowledge of science and help from my new assistant ([[Siri]]) it made this much quicker. Two of the vials I was given were filled with the ichor of past friends we had met and parted ways with, within their blood lies the curse of the “[[werewolf]]” a simpler term for [[Lycanthropy]]. To keep anonymity incase these notes are found by someone other than myself, I will only be using the initials of these our werewolf friends

In my tests it seems F’s ([[Finn]]) blood is weaker than T’s ([[Theodore]]), but still will inflict the curse of Lycanthrope, if injected into a willing or unwilling subject, though it will only turn the subject into a run of the mill [[werewolf]], nothing special.

  T’s blood is much more interesting, it seems to be imbued with some dark magic ([[shadowfell]] and [[dark divide]] as he was a [[dark cryomancer]]), and T has been inflicted for much longer then F And my guess is that T was the one to infect F seeing as in the notes I've read on Lycanthrope each strain of the curse is unique, and between them it’s same strain. Werewolves are fascinating due to this fact, within their blood is this curse that binds them in a way, that’s how werewolf packs/clans come about. But I digress., T’s blood being empowered by Black magic makes the process of infecting someone a much riskier endeavor as it is unknown if the subject would be able to handle the curse and the dark magic, and if the subject was cleansed of the Lycanthrope curse, the black magic could still linger within the host.


[[Polluted soil]]

This soil was collected at the site of a mutagen infected Ministry, it is unknown if this soil has any effect on organism’s planted within this soil, or if it infects anyone who ingests it. I have set an experiment in motion by planting some seeds in the soil and keeping it in a sealed jar. My hope is the soil has no effects on plants and the plant will simply wither, or grow normally without any trace of mutagen in them. If not then Mutagen could be used to target not just humans directly but even the food they eat, and if this soil was to infect just one farm, that easily could spread the epidemic much faster… let’s just hope it turns the plants into monsters, and not hosts for this mutagen plague.

 Blood of the “Blight of Withering” Guardian

Blood collected from the corpse of an enemy me and my party faced during the collapse of Cryomancers keep, before it was frozen. I am unaware of this Guardians origin, as whatever flesh it had was covered by a hulking suit of armor, I’m not even sure it had a body under that suit, but it must have since my companion collected its blood somehow. Anyway, back to the subject at hand

What's interesting about the blood is that it seems to exhibit the ability its host used against us, the ability to exhaust someone. It seems the blood itself has been affected by the use of this magic, if the blood is injected into a target it’ll cause the muscle to start to feel fatigued and weak. 

I find it interesting that the blood itself carries these properties and this fatigue is not caused simply by a spell or a weapon that has been enchanted. If only I had the blood from the other guardians, I could test to see if their blood follows a similar side effect as the Blight of withering. I wonder if these Blights are related to the Blight monsters I’ve read about, but that would mean the Blight of Withering was a plant and not a humanoid, so therefore it couldn't bleed actual blood.. Possibly a related species? Or maybe I’m looking too far into it.


[[Mutagen 2]]

While this topic has been previously researched, I thought I’d log my personal research into the subject.

So far I have tested a concentrated source of [[Mutagen 2]] on a single drop of clean blood, The Mutagen very quickly attacks the white blood cells, the white blood cells try fighting it off, but as the Mutagen Spreads , they begin recognizing healthy red blood cells as Mutagen infected cells, inadvertently spreading the infection faster. Once the blood is fully infected the blood began to heat up, clearly trying to spread further into the “host” but being unable to it seems to fizzle out and congeals to become a Mutagen 2 Biomass, once I lifted the Biomass of the plate I realized it left a scorch mark on the plate, meaning the blood boiled quite hot… A worrying study. Next I will try it in a larger quantity to see how that may change the process.

I have just tested a larger quantity of blood, and the results are near the same, I filled a mason jar with 3 quarts of blood, and dropped a single drop of Mutagen 2 into the jar, the same reaction happened, the healthy blood was quickly swallowed up, but when the blood heated up it was much hotter, even making the jar crack and leaving it scolding to the touch, I burned my finger trying to touch the damn jar. But inside was another much larger biomass of mutagen 2, I had the idea of adding pieces of skin I had in cold storage to the biomass to see its reaction. The biomass seemed to take the skin as its own, attaching the skin to itself as a sort of protective layer. If more blood and Skin were to be added, who knows what might come out of it… It couldn’t possibly become sentient? It would need a heart, a brain, some sort of muscles to move? Unless the mutagen itself acts as those things. More tests need to be performed.
