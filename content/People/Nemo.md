The reincarnation of [[Reginald]] after he died by [[Atlas]]'s fire at the [[Hightower Estate]].

Given new life by the [[New Flame]]

Came back very moody and brooding and irritating
Looks evil

Wears:
- Black suit
- bright red shirt
- Black cloak
- [[ivory mask]] with slits for eyes 
	- covers his fire burns from his death
		- Look like James Franco from Spiderman 3

Leaves black footprints in his wake

Is not only a member of the [[Circle of Embers]] but is on par with the [[Archdruid]]'s in rank
