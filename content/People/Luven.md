[[Petris]] & [[Aragella]]
Petris (Male) was older, and Aragella (Female) was the same age. You all grew up on the streets seeing the wealth around you, and decided to act and rob the Barons palace. The Baron at the time being [[Bentress]] Jendayi, a [[Giff]] (Hippo Person) Female, she possessed a [[lamp]] covered in shadowy cracks that glimmered with a faint white glow, that was told to hold the power of a [[Genie]], a type of mythical creature that only spoken about in legends, from a far off land swallowed by time and calamity Zakhara. you and your siblings decided to take this Lamp, you were the lucky one to take it in your hand. When you touched it you were pulled inside, a voice calling to you. "what is your wish?" Rings out the somber yet stern voice you replied "I wish to be the Baron of the Colossus Trading Post, and obtain all her wealth and power." The voice replied "As you wish, but a cost, there must be." You were then jettisoned from the lamp, you awoke in your bedroom, the heart of the Colossus Palace. Your family gone, along with the previous Baron. And you left to rule this Colossus Trading post, under the genies patronage.
