Flicker Frouden 
Half-elf
From the far west of the forest near [[Old Victoris]] 
Is from [[Bruelethor]]
Wears red robes
[[Embers' Draconic Wildshape]] is when he morphs to wings
But can also turn into a tiny lizard/salamander

Flicker is the [[cultist with the lens]], and his lens in his white cultist mask is a used as a scope. It is a high powered lens that has a crack in it that can conveniently be used as crosshairs.

The leader of the three [[Cultists]] of the [[Circle of Embers]] that attacked the [[Yew tavern]] in [[Shanon]]. Also seen at the [[Festival]] in the [[Amphitheater]] rafters, and shot the main actor with a [[gun]] ([[electric rail cannon]])

Great shot with a [[gun]]([[electric rail cannon]]) can shoot 3/4 mile

The sniper on the wall of the [[Cryomancer's Keep]] that shot at [[Perrin]] and [[Jadaya]]

Was who [[Atlas]] sent in his place to the [[Cryomancer's Keep]]
Had new red robes that now had with gold trim

Perrin remembered the masked Flicker was in his [[Rookwatch]] the night it burned down. 

Was Knighted as the eleventh [[Archdruid]] of the [[Circle of Embers]] due to his ability to finish the job that [[Atlas]] started. Was also promoted because of the finding of [[Sylas]] in the [[Dungeon outside Shannon]]. Claimed that was a happy coincidence, but it made [[Atlas]] happy with him.

Is now the 10th [[Archdruid]] because we froze one at the [[Cryomancer's Keep]]

Was groomed into this as a child to join the [[Circle of Embers]]
