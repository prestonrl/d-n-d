Perrin is a 38 year old gnome. He has medium length brown hair that is kind of spiky and unkept. He has a very short trimmed beard that is well kept, and notably not dwarvish looking at all. He has hazel eyes. He looks his age, not quite young, not quite old. His skin is tan and weathered. His hands are covered in callouses from mostly living on his own in the woods. He is fit and active, so he has a good amount of muscle and leanness to him. He is quick and nimble and can sneak around effectively if needed, so he is light on his feet. His clothes consist of green cloth and dark brown leather armor.
