Found in the final chamber of[[Dungeon outside Shannon]] by [[Perrin]]. The skeleton/corpse was on a throne. 
After trying to interact with the skeleton a green vial labeled [[Mutagen 3]] dropped out of the corpse's chest and shattered against the throne.

The skeleton had some sort of curse on the [[Cultists]] and was able to animate its dead body. After Perrin defeated the cultist the skeleton stood and told him he needed to leave now and then the entire [[Dungeon outside Shannon]] collapsed

~~Maybe the skeleton was [[Atlas]]? but that is a big guess~~

[[Sylas]] it is Slyas for sure
