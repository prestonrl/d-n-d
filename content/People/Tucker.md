Tucker Embergust
One of the guards of [[Shanon]]
Went missing suspiciously  before [[Perrin]] arrived in Shanon. Perrin was hired by [[Yin]] to locate him. He was found outside of the expansion district in the woods, slumped against a large rock being preyed on by a wolf. 

[[Marzia]] is his mother.

When he became conscious relayed that he had been hunting down the three [[Cultists]] 

Was a big help to Perrin on [[Festival]] night in defeating [[cultist with the lens]]
