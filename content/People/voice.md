Voice in [[Aben]]'s head

Hears voice saying they are the [[Herald of the Dragons Consort]]

- heard from rubble ramp in [[Aurum Briar Mine]] 
- "well done on [[Events/plan H]]" and a lift is being sent down a blue force field shows up with a number 60
- Aben talks to voice and asks for [[plan sigma]] which accelerates the elevator
- Sharp pain in neck and the voice says "not you, not yet"
