A mysterious ancient figure named in the note by the [[Circle of Embers]] that was found by [[Perrin]] in [[Dungeon outside Shannon]]

Wears white suit
Has white hair
Red cloak

Is a [[great wyrm]]

Can transform into an ancient red [[dragon]]

Was not at [[Cryomancer's Keep]] battles but sent [[Flicker]] in his place.
Was mentioned in [[Flicker's Letter]] 

So old and complex a creature that they are outside the concepts of sexuality, but regardless is probably into [[Sylas]]

Tried to stop the [[calamity]] of [[Old Victoris]], but was convinced with [[Sylas]] that it is best to finish what it started and bring about the [[Silence]].

Has spent the time since the fall of [[Old Victoris]] amassing the old guard that used to patrol the city, the [[Ember Guard]], and creating the [[Circle of Embers]] so that the their plans of destroying everything could be brought about.
